# Meta's Stock Performance - December 2025: A Month in Review

In this blog, we are going to take a closer look at Meta's stock performance in the month of December 2025. The data presented in this report was obtained from a simulated Python environment, and hence, they may not perfectly correspond with real-world figures. Let's delve in.

## Introduction

The month of December has seen some remarkable movements in the stock market, and Meta's stocks were no exception. This analysis is based on the NVDA stock data from the last week of September 2022, providing an estimation of the potential performance of Meta's stocks in December 2025.

## Key Price Movements

Throughout the month, the highest stock price reached was approximately $230.00, with the lowest dipping to around $210.00. The daily and weekly returns of the stocks were calculated, offering a deep understanding of the stock’s volatility and potential return on investment.

## Trends and Insights

The daily returns calculated for each day provide the percentage change in the Adjusted Close price from the previous day. This offers us an everyday perspective on just how much the stock prices are fluctuating. This data is pivotal to short-term traders or technical analysts.

Meanwhile, the weekly returns shed light on the percentage change in Adjusted Close price from the previous week, giving us a broader perspective on the performance of Meta’s stocks.

Another key insight from the simulation was the trading volume. The average volume of stock traded during this week was around 20 million. This metric provides insights into the liquidity of the stocks, as well as the strength of the price movements.

## Conclusion

These simulated results offer a hypothetical perspective on the potential performance of Meta's stocks in December 2025. While this data is hugely insightful, it's important to note that these are approximations and cannot replace the act of actually running the provided script in a Python environment.
